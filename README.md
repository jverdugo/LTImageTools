The software provide encoding and decoding of PNG files used in Lost Technology game and is on early stages of development since it was just thrown together with few information about the image encoding for the game engine based on information found in the game steam community page and discussion boards

Keep a backup of your game files before any attempt of overriding the current images, the tool ask for the game directory, an output directory where is going to write the encoded images and another one for the decoded images, load will bring the folder explorer where you chose a folder and the tool will attempt to read the images and determine if they are encoded or decoded.

When encoding your new images make sure to load the folder containing the decoded images you want to alter, you can mark the saveFile column to save selected images rather than the whole set.
